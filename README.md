## Overview

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Links

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The layout was tricky. I had to fight a lot with grids and flexboxes and I definetly should learn this topic in a more systematic way; it is a big hole in my understaning of CSS.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
